Hypothesis testing 
Generally a hypothesis testing is done to see whether a particular conditon or question 
can be answered with validation. 
We construct two sub query and validate them. The one accepting or siding with the question is
called as "NULL Hypothesis" and the one contradicting it is called as "Alternate Hypothesis".

There are 5 different ways we can conduct the hypothesis testing.
1) ANOVA analysis
2) T-Test 
3) Chi- Sqaure test 
4) F-Test 
5) Z-Test 

T- test 

Used to see if two data sets have any relation between them and also if the values in the data set
are the same as their means.
Used for smaller data sets .
Generally WE compare two samples.

The terms “significance level” or “level of significance” refer to the likelihood that the random sample you choose (for example, test scores) 
is not representative of the population. The lower the significance level, the more confident you can be in replicating your results. 
Significance levels most commonly used in educational research are the .05 and .01 levels. If it helps, think of .05 as another way of saying 95/100 times 
that you sample from the population, you will get this result. Similarly, .01 suggests that 99/100 times that you sample from the population, you will get the same result.
These numbers and signs (more on that later) come from Significance Testing, which begins with the Null Hypothesis.


We calculate the p-value and then decide on what we should be doing 

p ≥ .05	likely to be a result of chance (same as saying A = B)
difference is not significant
null is correct
“fail to reject the null”
There is no relationship between  A and B.

p ≤ .05	not likely to be a result of chance (same as saying A ≠ B)
difference is significant
null is incorrect
“reject the null”
There is a relationship between A and B.

* Always used paired T-test when you have data measured on the same subject or which has variables dependent on each other.
* QQ plot is always used to see if the data is normally dis or anderson darling test for one-sided.
* P-value is calculated by 
* Cochraian or pearson test for two-sided hypothesis testing .


ANOVA analysis 
To conduct a test with three or more variables, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) must be used.
